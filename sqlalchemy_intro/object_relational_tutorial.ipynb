    "The SQLAlchemy Object Relational Mapper presents a method of associating user-defined Python classes with database tables, and instances of those classes (objects) with rows in their corresponding tables.  \n",
    "It includes a system that transparently synchronizes all changes in state between objects and their related rows, called a unit of work, as well as a system for expressing database queries in terms of the user defined classes and their defined relationships between each other.  \n",
    "The ORM is in contrast to the SQLAlchemy Expression Language, upon which the ORM is constructed.  \n",
    "Whereas the SQL Expression Language, introduced in SQL Expression Language Tutorial, presents a system of representing the primitive constructs of the relational database directly without opinion, the ORM presents a high level and abstracted pattern of usage, which itself is an example of applied usage of the Expression Language.  \n",
    "While there is overlap among the usage patterns of the ORM and the Expression Language, the similarities are more superficial than they may at first appear.  \n",
    "One approaches the structure and content of data from the perspective of a user-defined domain model which is transparently persisted and refreshed from its underlying storage model.  \n",
    "The other approaches it from the perspective of literal schema and SQL expression representations which are explicitly composed into messages consumed individually by the database.  \n",
    "A successful application may be constructed using the Object Relational Mapper exclusively.  \n",
    "In advanced situations, an application constructed with the ORM may make occasional usage of the Expression Language directly in certain areas where specific database interactions are required."
